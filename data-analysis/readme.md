# Data Analysis

Once we have get access to enough data, the next in the data management plan to plug the data into our platform and perform data analysis to understand the data.

## Requirements
The requirements for this feature are:
- Connect to existing data (residing in a database or via batch uploading standard data files) and do exploratory analysis
- Identify relevant stakeholders
- Create graphical/visual representations to convey the scope of data
- Document goals and create dashboards
- Facililate the process of information mapping.

## Tools identified
Before we build the actual platform we wanted to understand the existing tools that already facilitate data analysis and hosted a couple of them to get more hands-on experience with them and understand how the data collected can be used with them.

1. Apache Superset
2. Metabase
3. RAWGraphs

### Apache Superset
Apace Superset is an open source data exploration and visualization platform that can integrate with modern databases.
More information on how to access our current instance of Superset and how to work with it can be found [here](./003-superset.md).

### Metabase
Metabase is a data analysis platform to analyse and share data that also lets users to create rich visualizations and get insights from data by running SQL queries. Detailed information to how to access and use Metabase can be found [here](./004-metabase.md).

### RAWGraphs
RAWGraphs work with demiliter-separated values (eg. CSV, TSV) and spreadsheets to visualize the data contained in them. It is a simple and lightweight alternative to Superset and Metabase.
