## How to Use Discourse?
### Nomenclature
Here are some very basic terms that will be helpful to keep in mind as you use Discourse or read this guide:

**Topic:** The collection of messages grouped together in a meaningful conversation, with a title, listed in a category, beginning with an Original Post, and including all replies in chronological order.
Elsewhere this might be called a ‘thread’ but Discourse uses ‘topic’ since thread is used for linked elements that can go off in many different directions (and be confused with programming terms).

**Post:** Each element of a topic is referred to as a post. Each post has its own author and can be moved to a different topic if necessary, or even become the start of a new topic.

**Original Post (or OP):** The first post in any topic. This is key since it determines the focus of the topic and is what the title and tags will link to.

**Category:** The primary means of organizing topics. Each topic is placed in exactly one category. Categories have permissions which can restrict which users can create, reply, and see its topics. You can also configure notification preferences per category or even mute them as explained below. Categories are a similar concept to a ‘forum’ on other sites.

**Tag:** A marker placed on a topic to describe it. While a topic can only have one category, it can have multiple tags. New tags can be created by some users. You can read more about the differences between tags and categories 74.

**User:** Discourse sites may be private or public for anyone to read, but you will always be required to register in order to create posts and record any actions such as bookmarking, liking, tagging, and flagging. Most site activity, therefore, is based around registered Users

Usage of the forum is well documented by the discource community [here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-guide/96331#browsing-the-forum)
