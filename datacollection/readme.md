# Data Collection

This folder contains details related to implementing the data collection feature.

### Challenges:
- The current way of collecting data is inefficient due to being mostly paper based, you have to manually email all the relevant stakeholders
- No standardization of availability and use
- No clear way of utilizing the data sitting in the source
- Need to analyze, annotate data to derive the necessary information out of it
- Problems related to the collection system that include but not limited to double entry, incorrect data etc.

### Requirements:
- Single system to collect data
- Collecting data on multiple factors (both quantitative and qualitative)
- Ability to build forms that allow flexibility
- Periodically update existing data and collect new data
- Store the collected data for further analysis

### Tools identified
1. OpenDataKit(ODK)
2. KoboToolbox

We self-hosted OpenDataKit and it can be accessed via this URL: https://noralodk.civicdays.in

#### Guide on how to use ODK:
Here, you can find the instructions on how to use ODK that is currently live:
