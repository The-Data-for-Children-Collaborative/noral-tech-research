# Data management plan

A list of high level goals:
- Collect data
- Transform data into a specific standard
- Store data
- Retrieve data and feed it into a data analytics tool

## Collect data

We identified ODK as one of the data collection tooling options. Data is collected via custom forms created on [ODK Build](https://build.getodk.org).


## Transform data

Data collected via ODK is transformed into frictionless data through [Frictionless Framework](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io).


## Store Data


## Retrieve and analyze data
